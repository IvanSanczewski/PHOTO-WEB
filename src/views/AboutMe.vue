            <p>I am a documentary photographer based in Vilnius. Born and raised in Barcelona,  I have spent the last 15 years working for several magazines, newspapers, wedding agencies and even the commercial department of the largest wine shop in Spain. I have also been teaching photography since I finished my postgraduate degree in Photojournalism.
                During that time, I have extensively travelled around Europe, developing a broad documentary work covering humanitarian crises such as 2015's Refugees, which I exposed in December 2017 at the UNESCO Gallery in Vilnius.</p>
            <p>As my passion for photography grew, I created several workshops covering different genres and techniques, from Portrait to Reportage, from Basic Photoshop and Lightroom to more specific Black & White Conversion Techniques. 
                In 2014 I created the Street Happens Workshops, sharing my knowledge and expertise with worldwide photographers, curating their exhibitions and participating in the Street Arts Festival of Mostar, Bosnia Herzegovina, in 2016 or collaborating with Sparkle Workshops from Verona, Italy.</p>
